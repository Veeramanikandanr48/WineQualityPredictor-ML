# Wine Quality Predictor

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting the quality of wines based on various attributes and characteristics. The goal is to provide an accurate assessment of wine quality using advanced algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Random Forests.

## Project Highlights

- Utilizes machine learning techniques to predict wine quality
- Implements Logistic Regression and Random Forests algorithms
- Provides valuable insights for wine evaluation and assessment
- Enhances wine experiences through data-driven predictions

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/veeramanikandanr48/WineQualityPredictor-ML.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Run the main script: `python wine_quality_predictor.py`
2. Enter the input data for wine attributes.
3. Obtain the predicted quality of the wine based on the trained model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is available in the `data` directory. It contains a collection of wine samples with corresponding quality ratings.
